# About

**Hi... everyone!** 🙋🏽 (Shamelessly inspired from [Yilong Ma's greeting](https://www.tiktok.com/@mayilong0))

My name's Hoby and since September 2020, I've been self-learning software development, and since spring 2022, decided to specialize into Artificial Intelligence. More specifically in Data Science and Machine Learning. 👨‍💻  

On this website, I'll share detailed information about the projects I'm developing as well as my feedback on courses I've taken. [Here]() you can access my portfolio of data science/ML projects.

From the beginning, I've been learning on Udemy. The list of courses I took/have been taking so far:
* [Complete Python Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/)
* [Complete Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/)
* [C Programming for Beginners - Master the C Language]()
* [Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond]()
