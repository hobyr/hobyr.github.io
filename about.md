# About

**Hi... everyone!** üôãüèΩ (Shamelessly copied from [Elon Musk's doppelg√§nger Yilong Ma's
greeting](https://www.tiktok.com/@mayilong0))

My name's Hoby and since September 2020, I've been self-learning software development, and since
spring 2022, decided to specialize into Artificial Intelligence where I'm gaining skills in Data
Science and Machine Learning. üë®‚Äçüíª  

But in early 2023, I had a change of heart, going into Web Development. Currently learning with 3
different resources.

## My story

In university, I studied Mechanical Engineering and specialized in Mechanical Design. There I learnt
about CAD and CAE, but also a tiny bit of programming in Matlab.

In 2015, I had the opportunity to brush up my skills in programming. I successfully landed an
internship as a software developer at Renault's main R&D center near Paris. I was using Matlab for 6
months, with little knowledge, and built a complete app (with some help from my supervisor) to speed
up their design process. A lot of math was involved, but what I'm most proud of is actually learning
the Matlab language on the job, and finishing the app by the very end of my internship.

In the second half of 2016, I had my final internship in Japan, where I was hired as a mechanical
engineer, designing testing machines. A lot of mechanical design was involved, but there was some
programming as well, on the PLCs, and fortunately, my experience proved useful. Funny enough, I was
also asked to use Matlab to split up large data files and gather only relevant data. I felt I made
the right choice with my first internship.

After graduating, I started working in Japan as a test engineer, which was really interesting as I
could see the "behind the scenes" for certifying products before releasing them onto the market. But
I realized this was not what I wanted to do, so I quit to find a job where product design was
essential. I looked for jobs in Japan, this is where I wanted to be.

But COVID-19 happened, and I couldn't stay in Japan. But my hopes of coming back to Japan are still
strong as ever, and I targeted a startup in Osaka, that was designing small robots. Mechatronics at
its best. I had experience in mechanical engineering but not much in software development (besides
Matlab).

So I decided to teach myself software development. Started with some Data Structures and Algorithms
(aka DSA) then Python. I wanted to get into Robotics so I tried to learn at [The
Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/), but quickly realized I needed C++ knowledge as well
and started a C course then a C++ course to get familiar with the syntax.

Completing it, I came back to The Construct to learn about ROS. But being by myself, I had a really
hard time, I didn't know anyone in the robotics field. So I moved towards AI, Machine Learning and
Data Science. It became pretty intense, and I thought I was really interested in it, but by the end
of 2022, I lost interest.

This time, I switched to Web Development. And I plan on sticking to it, because I see it as a
complete package. Design (creativity) and logic (cognitive work and problem solving) as a full-stack
engineer. Also, many friends of mine switched from a job where they were bored, to a career in tech.
I believe I'm able to do that as well.

## Why this website?

Here I'll share detailed information about the projects I'm developing as well as my feedback on
courses I've taken. [Here]() you can access my portfolio of as a web developer.

I've most learned on Udemy, but as I strongly believe in diversity in learning, I tried learning
from other trusted sources too. The list of courses I took/have been taking so far:
