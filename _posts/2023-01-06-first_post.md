# Hello world

This is my first post on this blog where I'll share my progress about:
* Learning software development
* Learning data science
* Learning machine learning
* Portfolio projects
* Tips for my data science setup

I'm looking forward to sharing all of that with you! And remember some quotes for me and you:

About the journey to mastery:
> Enjoy the process

For perfectionists like myself:
> Strive for perfection, but... progress over perfection  

We want to achieve big things. Ambition requires time and thus:
> Consistent small actions compound into great results!
