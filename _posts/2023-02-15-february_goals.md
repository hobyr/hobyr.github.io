# Goals for February 2023 [Web Dev Learning Journey]

In my previous post, I described my strategy to ideally become a Full-Stack Web Developer by August
2023. Nonetheless, getting a chance to work as a Front-End or Back-End engineer at first is
something I'd be happy with, as a stepping stone.

I managed to complete all my goals for January 2023, and I'd like to share in this post more details
about my strategy for February.

## Monthly Goals

As a reminder, here are my goals for this month:

1. [ ] **Finish CSS Foundations section on The Odin Project**: I'd be able to design pages and content,
   ideally make my resume look good online.
2. [ ] **Finish the Tribute Page project on FreeCodeCamp**: I'll have another project to show on my
    GitHub, with a larger tech stack hopefully.
3. [ ] **Complete the CSS sections on Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp**: A second resource to cement my
    CSS knowledge, as well as learning about Flexbox and Bootstrap.

Monthly goals are great, but I believe weekly goals are better to make sure I stay on track and
regularly review my progress. I can then see if I'm behind or not.

## Weekly Goals

These are goals I write in my notebook, and I even have daily goals, or simply daily tasks. I put a
lot of emphasis on Colt Steele's course on my notebook. However, I'll add other resources here
because I have more space. Here they are for the February:

- **Week 1 (01.30 to 02.05)**: Finish sections 5 & 6 of Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp.
- **Week 2 (02.06 to 02.12)**: Finish sections 7 & 8 of Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp + finish Survey
    Form project from FreeCodeCamp.
- **Week 3 (02.13 to 02.19)**: Finish sections 9 & 10 of Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp + get to
    Flexbox project from FreeCodeCamp.
- **Week 4 (02.20 to 02.26)**: Finish sections 11 & 12 of Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp + start
    section 13.


### Week 1 (01.30 to 02.05)

I managed to complete all the goals for this week including the CSS Colors and the HTML forms
projects from FreeCodeCamp.

Secondly, on The Odin Project, aka TOP, I completed the _Working with text_ lesson in the _HTML
Foundations_ section. Quite easy for me as I've been also watching the Udemy bootcamp that dealt
with that topic as well.

Quite proud of the achievement, progressing little by little each day. I still find it hard to
adjust to this rhythm as I'm used to doing so much in the day. Binging on the bootcamp videos, and
trying to squeeze as much as possible. This feels more sustainable.

When I wasn't actively working on learning Web Development, I wanted to spend some time learning
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), the Python framework to develop web apps. I managed to go
until tutorial 3. It's very different from static HTML/CSS, but eventually, I believe I'll have to
work with framework such as React.js or Vue.js for Front-End, and then Back-End frameworks like
Django, ExpressJS, Spring Boot or Ruby on Rails. It's a good introduction.
