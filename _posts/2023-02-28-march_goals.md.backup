# Goals for March 2023

March 2023 will be my second full-fledged month in learning Web Development, and I'm excited for it. As I mentioned in my [previous post](https://hobyr.github.io/2023/02/27/week_5_learning_log.html), it's the time when I'll start learning JavaScript, one of the most used programming languages for Web Development. The main one for Front-End, and a very popular one for Back-End (others being PHP, Python or Ruby).

I'm already expecting it to be much more challenging than HTML and CSS, but as I've got some experience in programming (interned as a Software Developer in Renault back in 2015, a while ago but still got some remains), and I already learnt Python, C and C++, it's the syntax that will take some time.

## The curriculum

The world of JavaScript is very, incredibly vast, and it'll probably take me some months to get to the bottom of it. It's both used in Front-End and Back-End.

So this month will be all about fundamentals. There will be some design remaining, but the core focus of this month is JS.

## Monthly goals

I've yet to describe the whole curriculum in my planner, but I believe I'll complete the first 5 JavaScript sections in the Udemy course, until the JS Object Literals. But my goal is to reach the _Newer JavaScript features_ section, which is 10 sections away from where I'm now. Realistic? I don't know but I'll see how my progress goes throughout the month.

I set a goal of finishing the JavaScript Basics chapter from the Odin Project, as there are 3 **really interesting** projects that I want to complete, and I want to take enough time to really understand JS, and not rushing through it. I think this chapter will be very thorough with a lot of assignments, and I feel like I'll understand a lot when I'm done with it.

And finally, I'll go through this project once again, albeit from a different source, the *Landing Page Project* on FreeCodeCamp. I've yet to finish the Responsive Web Design course, but it's thorough and, despite having a lot of hand-holding, I still learn a lot.

So to recap:

1. At least reach **JavaScript Object Literals** section on Udemy. **Ultimate goal: Newer JavaScript features** section.
2. **Complete the JavaScript Basics chapter on The Odin Project**: with 3 projects on it, this is a great learning opportunity.
3. **Get through the Landing Page Project on FreeCodeCamp**. Ideally complete the whole Responsive Web Design course but it's fine if I don't.

## Weekly goals

Weekly goals are, in my view, as important as monthly goals, as we can keep track of progress without micro-managing. So here are the weeks that I consider for this month:

- **Week 6 (02.27 to 03.05)**: 
	+ Finish the *Balance sheet project* on FreeCodeCamp.
	+ Get to the *JavaScript Developer Tools* chapter on The Odin Project.
	+ Complete *JavaScript Basics* on Udemy.
- **Week 7 (03.06 to 03.12)**: Step up a notch by:
	+ Completing the *Technical Documentation Page project* on FreeCodeCamp.
	+ Get to the *Node.js chapter* on The Odin Project.
	+ Finish *JavaScript Strings* + start *JavaScript Decision Making* on Udemy.
- **Week 8 (03.13 to 03.19)**: This week will be tough to evaluate because I've got something very important coming up in my personal life. Setting aside time to learn will be difficult. So I haven't set any goal for that particular week.
- **Week 9 (03.20 to 03.26)**: 
	+ Finish the *Landing Page project* on FreeCodeCamp.
	+ Complete the *JavaScript Basics* chapter on The Odin Project with the *Calculator project*.
	+ Finish the *JavaScript Object Literals* section on Udemy.
- **Week 10 (03.27 to 04.02)**:
	+ Complete the *Responsive Web Design* course on FreeCodeCamp by completing the *Personal Portfolio Webpage project*.
	+ Finish *The Back End* section on Odin Project.
	+ Get to section 20: *Introducing Functions* on Udemy.

As always I try to keep my goals realistic, and stay flexible if I can't manage to complete all goals on time. I can move them around or reschedule. **Making progress** is more important than strictly completing goals for the sake of completing them.

At least now I have a detailed timeline of how my progress can look like this upcoming month.

<hr>

I keep saying it: I'm looking forward to getting into JavaScript and make web pages more interactive.

I still have to take the Coursera course into account too, so that I can also have a feeling of accomplishment. I learnt a lot already and there's still some stuff that I probably don't know that will be taught in this final week of the course.

A lot to deal with, but it's a path that I chose, and as long as I'm persevering, I'm good. See you in the next post.
