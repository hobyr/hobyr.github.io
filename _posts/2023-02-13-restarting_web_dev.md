# Restarting my journey with Web Development

We're February 13, 2023. It's been nearly three weeks since I started learning web development
again. I had a brief stint with it in mid-2021 before moving onto Robotics, Python and C++.

_Why, you might ask?_

I almost completed the Data Science bootcamp on Udemy, but I couldn't feel any excitement or
motivation to keep going at it. In order to get a job as a Data Scientist, having a portfolio is
essential, and I didn't know where to start.

I may be overly critical of my work, and I think I didn't dive deep enough or practiced the
exercises well enough to claim I was close to mastering the subject.

Anyway, the reason I'm getting back into Web Development is because of the sheer number of offers on
the market, and how it's complete. Meaning that you can deal with design (Front-End) and/or logic
(Back-End). And as a person who's extremely curious, I feel I can express myself well in that kind
of job.


## My plan of attack

I know I have a tendency to set overly ambitious or unattainable goals, just to end up unmotivated
and exhausted.

This time, I chose to make a real plan and stick to it. To that end, I used a planner to define
**realistic** deadlines when it comes to my learning. Realistic deadlines are still hard to define
though. I try to imagine goals that are attainable considering my environment, how I manage my time
and energy, as well as how long a course chapter or section, including exercises and practice, may
take.

> If you fail to plan, you're planning to fail.

This quote resonated with me since I came back to Japan looking for work. I've been planning my days
and weeks by hand on a notebook, and since then, I feel more peaceful, less stressed and overwhelmed
with my goals and deadlines.

Taking time to plan gave me some sense of accomplishment, and also, seeing the tasks I'd plan for
the following days motivated me to take action. Another bonus is that I'd be able to monitor my
progress easily instead of having tasks disappear on my phone after crossing them out.

Let me first describe what I'll use to get knowledge and skills.


### Learning Resources

I used to learn only from Udemy courses, which is a fantastic resource but I believe in learning
from several sources. Before diving into Web Development, I went on Reddit and searched for
recommended courses or bootcamps. I picked three of them:

1. **Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp 2023**, which I already purchased way back in 2021, and
   not finished yet.
2. **The Odin Project** which is an open-source complete course to become a Full-Stack Web
   Developer with either JavaScript or Ruby (or both if you wish).
3. **FreeCodeCamp**, a popular resource which is only project-based, and therefore good to build
   up a portfolio. There are also so many YouTube videos on several topics around Computer Science
   and Career Development.

I think I learn well through videos, I accumulate knowledge, but I also realized that I can learn a
lot through reading too. I can go at my own pace and not being limited by the video's.

I hesitated for long before signing up to **The Odin Project** and **FreeCodeCamp**, because I
wasn't sure how reliable they were. But after reading feedback on Reddit,

Now, let me share with you how I would tackle learning and the different goals I set for myself.


### Learning strategy

Since my plan now is to work as a (ideally) full-stack web developer by August 2023, I still have 7
months to reach my goal. I know however that being a seasoned full-stack engineer in 7 months is
quite ambitious. This is what I strive for, but being a Front-End Web Developer at first or a
Back-End engineer is something I'd be pleased with.

In the past, I had a goal of finishing a section a day, and I didn't really see how troubling that
was. I put a lot of pressure on myself and that's certainly the reason that led me to quit it. Not a
burnout but still became so overwhelmed that I couldn't continue anymore.

I first set monthly goals, starting from January. So far, I planned until the end of March to verify
if my strategy is sustainable.

#### January 2023

1. Finish the Introduction section on The Odin Project
2. Finish the Learn CSS Colors project on FreeCodeCamp
3. Finish the HTML Semantics section on Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp

#### February 2023

1. Finish CSS Foundations section on The Odin Project
2. Finish the Tribute Page project on FreeCodeCamp
3. Complete the CSS sections on Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp

#### March 2023

1. Finish JavaScript basics on The Odin Project
2. Finish the Landing Page project on FreeCodeCamp
3. Complete section 23 (Newer JS features) on Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp

I also set weekly goals to make sure I stay on track. Having some regular short deadlines is a good
way to keep motivation high and be accountable. By having it on my planner, I immediately know if I
fell behind or not.

Finally, I know that if I miss some days of learning or didn't complete certain tasks, I can
postpone them, and I also remind myself _not to be too harsh on myself_ due to the detrimental
effects it can have on my mind.


### Other helping resources

Before deciding to go back to learning Web Development, I made quite a lot of research to maximize
the chances of succeeding and pushing through the hard times. I know a friend of mine took
approximately 2 years before successfully switching from English teaching in Japan to being a
Software Developer.

Some resources advised to take a course on [**Learning How to
Learn**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), and I've been learning some
fascinating facts about the brain on learning and how to overcome certain hurdles during learning.

Finally, through these three resources, there are large communities that are always happy to help
and makes learning more enjoyable and less lonely. Online learning is mostly a lonely endeavor that
can take a toll on the mind.

### I know I can do it.

> If you fail to plan, you're planning to fail.

I think this quote summarizes how I approach learning Web Development again. Citing the well-known
book "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill, he extensively talks about the power of autosuggestion.
I've been trying this myself for a few weeks. I do feel a change in how I approach life, and how I'm
able to plan more long-term than seeking immediate reward. It's difficult but I believe it's amply
worth trying this technique.

In the next posts, I'll share a bit more about my plan for February and keep updates on how my
learning goes.
