# Restarting my journey with Web Development

We're February 13, 2023. It's been nearly three weeks since I started
learning web development again. I had a brief stint with it in mid-2021
before moving onto Robotics, Python and C++.

_Why, you might ask?_

I almost completed the Data Science bootcamp on Udemy, but I couldn't
feel any excitement or motivation to keep going at it. In order to get a
job as a Data Scientist, having a portfolio is essential, and I didn't
know where to start.

I may be overly critical of my work, and I think I didn't dive deep
enough or repracticed the exercises well enough to claim I was close to
mastering the subject.

> If you fail to plan, you're planning to fail.

This quote resonated with me since I came back to Japan looking for
work. I've been planning my days and weeks by hand on a notebook, and
since then, I feel more peaceful, less stressed and overwhelmed with my
goals and deadlines.

Taking time to plan gave me some sense of accomplishment, and also,
seeing the tasks I'd plan for the following days motivated me to take
action. Another bonus is that I'd be able to monitor my progress easily
instead of having tasks disappear on my phone after crossing them out.

Well, my plan now is to get a web developer job by August 2023. I still
have 7 months to reach my goal.
